            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a MSCS candidate at San Jose State University. Before starting my degree at SJSU, I worked at Model.Earth as a volunteer and helped build various interfaces and features for the nonprofit.
                My biggest project at Model.Earth was building an LLM-based application to provide insights on github repositories to help onboard new volunteers. I have also worked as a Software Developer Intern at Global Quality Corp. and Ticketmaster.
                At Global Quality Corp., I built data pipelines and computer vision models to help assess the quality of sewage pipes and determine if they needed to be repaired.
                At Ticketmaster, I worked on building a new internal tool to help manage and monitor the health of various services.
