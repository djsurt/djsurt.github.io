                <p>
                    I am an MSCS candidate at San Jose State University with a passion for building meaningful technology solutions. Previously, I volunteered at Model.Earth, developing interfaces and features for the nonprofit organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My biggest project there was an LLM-based application designed to provide insights on GitHub repositories, helping onboard new volunteers more effectively. This experience sparked my interest in leveraging AI to solve real-world problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have also gained valuable industry experience as a Software Developer Intern at Global Quality Corp. and Ticketmaster, where I worked on diverse projects ranging from data pipelines and computer vision models to service monitoring tools.
